                    I'm currently enrolled in the K18 course at FPT Polytechnic. My student code is TS00628, and I'm in
                    class SD1803. I have a deep love for Asian ancient culture, which shows in my hobbies. I enjoy
                    playing games and reading online novels, especially those with Chinese fantasy themes. Besides that,
                    I'm really into music with calm, ancient Asian instruments. My brother and I share almost the same
                    interests because, well, we're twins after all!

                    My teacher in the SD1803 class at FPT Polytechnic has a lot of different interests. She loves trying
                    all kinds of food and stays active with sports. She's also really into practicing English and
                    watching American movies. Her passion for these things makes her a lively and engaging teacher!

                <p>
                    When it comes to physical fitness, I’d say my shape is pretty average—not great, but not terrible
                    either. I sometimes walk around the park behind my apartment, but I don’t have a strict workout
                    routine. When I do exercise, it’s usually just a half-hour walk, and somehow, my body stays in
                    decent shape despite not doing much.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As for my eating habits, I mostly go for cheap, random foods, though I like to treat myself to
                    something nicer now and then. I avoid foods that could harm my health because they’re not just bad
                    but also not as cheap as they seem. Fast food, in particular, is a no-go because of the
                    hidden health risks and costs. Bad eating habits include hitting up fast food too often or skipping
                    meals, while good habits mean sticking to a balanced diet and eating regularly.

                    Staying in shape is key to feeling good and staying healthy. A balanced diet and some regular
                    exercise help keep things in check. I usually sleep about 6-7 hours a night, hitting the sack around
                    11 PM. It helps me keep a balanced routine and stay on top of my fitness.

                    During my latest vacation, I took a trip to Da Lat with my family. We hopped on a bus and spent a
                    week at a cozy hotel. The journey was smooth, and the hotel made for a comfy base for all our
                    adventures.

                    Da Lat's weather was a mix of foggy and chilly, a nice change from the usual heat we’re used to.
                    Despite the cold, the local food was amazing, and the people were super friendly, which really made
                    the trip enjoyable. We spent our days checking out the famous tourist spots around the city, soaking
                    in the scenic views and lively vibes.

                    What I loved most was the chance to kick back and relax, leaving work stress behind. The only
                    bummer? The week flew by too fast, and I wish we had more time to explore. Da Lat, with its cool
                    climate and beautiful landscapes, is a place I got to know thanks to my parents. The peacefulness
                    and refreshing air made it a getaway to remember.

                    I usually pick my clothes depending on the occasion. For casual outings like school or a movie, I go
                    for informal outfits because they're comfy. But when it comes to formal events like weddings or
                    funerals, I stick with formal wear to fit the vibe. Even though I find casual clothes way more
                    comfortable, I can deal with dressing up when I have to.

                    I don't actually shop for my own clothes; my mom takes care of that and usually does it online. So,
                    I don’t have a specific preference for sleepwear since she picks everything for me. I just wear
                    whatever she chooses, which means I don’t have much say in my wardrobe.

                <p>
                    When it comes to special events, formal attire is a must to show respect and follow social norms.
                    Wearing casual clothes to something formal could come off as disrespectful. At school, even wearing
                    a uniform just on Mondays helps create a sense of equality and discipline. All in all, while I’m all
                    about the comfort of casual clothes, I get why dressing right for different occasions is important.

                    Let me tell you, commuting between home and school on my motorbike is both a blessing and a curse.
                    Sure, it takes only 10 minutes, which is great and all, but seriously, when it rains? It’s like the
                    universe just wants to mess with me. I mean, who thought it was a good idea to ride something with
                    practically zero protection against a downpour? But hey, it's quick, it's cheap, and it’s what I’ve
                    got, so I deal with it. But I swear, if I get drenched one more time, I’m gonna start charging the
                    rain for the privilege of ruining my day!

                <p>
                    Now, let’s talk about motorbikes versus cars~because why not compare a nimble, two-wheeled
                    life-ruiner to a four-wheeled box of comfort? Motorbikes are great for short trips and dodging
                    traffic like a pro, but let’s be real~they offer about as much protection as a paper towel in a
                    hurricane. And don’t get me started on cargo space~good luck carrying anything more than a backpack!
                    Meanwhile, cars are all about comfort, safety, and staying dry, but they’ll drain your wallet faster
                    than a vampire at a blood bank. So, pick your poison yet nimble death trap or rolling bank account?
                </p>

                <p>
                    And for those longer trips, like going from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City? Flying is the only sane
                    option. I’m not about to waste a whole day on a train or bus when I can be there in a couple of
                    hours. But, let’s face it, vacations are expensive and frankly, too much hassle. So, while flying is
                    great, it’s not like I’m rushing to book a ticket anytime soon. If I’m gonna burn through cash, it
                    better be for something more fun than sitting in a metal tube at 30,000 feet.
